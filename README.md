If the section about starting the server in a separate thread and running the integration test is already included, we can focus specifically on explaining how the **client library works** and **how to run the integration test**, without repeating the threading setup or server startup process. Here's a concise explanation:

## **How the Client Library Works**

The `VideoTranslationClient` is a Python client library that polls a video translation server's `/status` endpoint to track the progress of a job. Its design emphasizes efficiency and reliability through:

1. **Polling Logic**:
   - The client sends repeated requests to the server until it gets a final response (`"completed"` or `"error"`) or the timeout is reached.
   - Between retries, it waits using exponential backoff to minimize unnecessary server load.

2. **Configurable Parameters**:
   - **`base_url`**: The URL of the video translation server.
   - **`max_retries`**: Maximum number of retry attempts.
   - **`backoff_factor`**: Factor by which the wait time increases (e.g., 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds).
   - **`timeout`**: The total time before polling stops.

3. **Timeout and Retry Management**:
   - If the client does not receive a final response before the timeout, it raises a `TimeoutError`.
   - If the client reaches the maximum retry count, it raises an exception indicating that retries were exhausted.

4. **Detailed Logs**:
   - Logs each step of the process, including retry attempts, sleep durations, and the final status.

## **How to Run the Integration Test**

1. **Run the Integration Test File**:
   - Execute the test by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python integration_test.py
     ```

2. **What Happens During the Test**:
   - The server starts in a separate thread and listens for requests.
   - The `VideoTranslationClient` polls the `/status` endpoint using exponential backoff until it retrieves the final status or the timeout is reached.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - If the server responds with `"completed"` or `"error"` within the timeout, the integration test prints the final status.
   - Example output:
     ```
     Integration Test: Final status from server: completed
     Integration Test: Completed
     ```
   - If the server does not respond with a final status within the timeout, the test raises a `TimeoutError` or an appropriate exception.

### **Summary**

- **How the Client Library Works**: Efficiently polls the server using exponential backoff and configurable parameters while logging each step.
- **How to Run the Integration Test**: Simply run `python integration_test.py` to test the client-server interaction, ensuring the system behaves as expected under real-world conditions.

This concise explanation avoids duplicating the setup and focuses on the specific behaviors and usage of the client library and integration test.
